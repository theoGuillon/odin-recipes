    <h1>A Long Drink</h1>

    <p><strong>A Long Drink</strong> is dedicated to good drinking and great living. We inspire, entertain and educate
        anyone—and everyone—interested in what happens in the glass and out of it. Cocktail recipes; home bar know-how;
        bottle recommendations; industry intel and job advice for the bar professional; profiles of the people who
        matter; the bars and cities to visit—if it centers on the act of drinking and how to live life to the fullest,
        Liquor.com will tell its story. Our readership is diverse. Everyone from a curious drinker seeking a recipe to a
        top-tier bar professional researching how to reduce their business’ overhead relies on Liquor.com as a valued
        resource.</p>
