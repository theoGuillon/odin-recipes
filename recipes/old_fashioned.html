    <h2>HISTORY</h2>
    <p>The Old Fashioned is a time-honored cocktail. Consisting of the fundamental aspects that makes a drink a
        cocktail—spirits, bitter, sugar and ice—it stands the test of time both through its elegant simplicity as well
        as its versatility. While traditionally made with whiskey, especially bourbon, any spirit will do in an Old
        Fashioned. Admittedly, though, the darker, aged spirits tend to work best, including aged rums.</p>
