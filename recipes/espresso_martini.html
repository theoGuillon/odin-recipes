    <h2>HISTORY</h2>
    <p>The now-classic drink was invented by British bartender Dick Bradsell at Fred’s Club in London. Legend has it
        that a "top model" asked for a drink that would “wake me up and f**k me up” at the same time. Bradsell complied,
        mixing vodka with espresso and coffee liqueur, and the Espresso Martini was born.</p>
